# Open Code Review

A skill for invoking [open-code-review](https://github.com/alibaba/open-code-review) (`ocr`) — an open-source AI code review CLI that reads Git diffs and generates structured, line-level review comments.

## Prerequisites check

Before starting a review, verify the environment:

```bash
# 1. Check the CLI is installed
which ocr || echo "NOT INSTALLED"

# 2. Verify LLM connectivity
ocr llm test
```

If `ocr` is not installed, install it first:

```bash
npm install -g @alibaba-group/open-code-review
```

If `ocr llm test` fails, the user must configure an LLM. Guide them with one of these options:

**Option A — Environment variables (highest priority, recommended for CI):**

```bash
export OCR_LLM_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
export OCR_LLM_TOKEN=<api-key>
export OCR_LLM_MODEL=claude-opus-4-6
export OCR_USE_ANTHROPIC=true
```

**Option B — Persistent config:**

```bash
ocr config set llm.url https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages
ocr config set llm.auth_token <api-key>
ocr config set llm.model claude-opus-4-6
ocr config set llm.use_anthropic true
```

Stop here and ask the user to provide credentials — never invent or hardcode API keys.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Business Context

Analyze the review target (commits, branch, or changes) to extract concise business context. Pass this context via `--background` to improve review quality.

### Step 2: Run Code Review

Run the OCR command with appropriate flags. **Always pass business context via `--background`** when available:

```bash
ocr review --audience agent --background "business context here" [user-args]
```

**Argument handling:**

- **Background context** (RECOMMENDED): use `--background "context"` or `-b "context"` to provide business context for better review quality
- **Default** (no user arguments): reviews staged, unstaged, and untracked changes (workspace mode)
- **Specific commit**: use `--commit` or `-c` to review a single commit against its parent
- **Branch comparison**: use `--from <ref>` and `--to <ref>` to review diff between two refs
- **Timeout**: default timeout is 10 minutes per file; adjust with `--timeout <minutes>`
- **Concurrency**: default concurrency is 8 file workers; reduce with `--concurrency <n>` if rate limits are hit
- **Preview mode**: use `--preview` or `-p` to preview which files will be reviewed without running the LLM
- **Installation**: if `ocr` command is not found, install it by running `npm i -g @alibaba-group/open-code-review`

**Common invocation patterns:**

| User says | Command to run |
|-----------|---------------|
| "review my changes" / "review the working copy" | `ocr review --audience agent -b "context"` |
| "review this PR" / "review feature branch" | `ocr review --audience agent -b "context" --from main --to <branch>` |
| "review commit abc123" | `ocr review --audience agent -b "context" --commit abc123` |
| "what would be reviewed?" (dry-run) | `ocr review --preview` |

**Output mode:**

- Always use `--audience agent` to suppress progress UI and emit only the final summary
- **Prevent output truncation**: For large reviews or restricted tool environments, redirect output to a temporary file (`ocr review --audience agent ... > /tmp/ocr_out.txt 2>&1`) and inspect it in full via a file reading tool instead of piping through `tail` or `head`, which drops earlier review comments.

### Step 3: Classify and Report

For each comment from the review output, classify by priority and report all issues to the user:

- **High**: Obvious bugs, security issues, clear mistakes, or well-founded suggestions with precise fix proposals
- **Medium**: Reasonable concerns but context-dependent, style/performance suggestions, or fixes that require manual implementation
- **Low**: Likely false positives, lacking sufficient context, nitpicks, or meaningless suggestions

Report all comments grouped by priority level.

### Step 4: Fix

Before applying fixes, check whether the user requested automatic fixes:

- If the user explicitly requested "review and fix" or similar, proceed with automatic fixes
- If the user only requested "review" without fix intent, ask for permission before applying any changes

When fixing issues and suggestions:

- Focus on High and Medium priority items
- Apply fixes directly to the code when safe and well-defined
- For complex fixes requiring manual intervention, clearly describe what needs to be done
- Always verify fixes with the user before committing

## Output Format

Each comment contains:

- `path`: File path
- `content`: Review comment text
- `start_line` / `end_line`: Line range (both 0 means positioning failed)
- `suggestion_code`: Optional fix suggestion
- `existing_code`: Optional original code snippet
- `thinking`: Optional LLM reasoning process

After filtering comments by priority, present results using this template:

```markdown
## Code Review Results

**Files reviewed**: N
**Issues found**: X high priority / Y medium priority

### High Priority

- **`path/to/file.java:42`** — Brief description
  > Recommendation: How to fix

### Medium Priority

- **`path/to/file.ts:88`** — Brief description
  > Recommendation: How to fix (if applicable)
```

If the review found no issues after filtering, simply state: "Review complete — no issues found in N files."

**Priority classification:**

- **High**: Obvious bugs, security issues, clear mistakes, or well-founded suggestions with precise fix proposals
- **Medium**: Reasonable concerns but context-dependent, style/performance suggestions, or fixes that require manual implementation
- **Low**: Discarded silently (likely false positives, lacking context, nitpicks, or meaningless suggestions)

**Handling mispositioned comments:**

When `start_line` and `end_line` are both `0`, the comment failed to locate the exact position in the file. In such cases:

1. Read the comment content to understand the issue
2. Examine the target file mentioned in the comment
3. Identify the relevant code section based on the comment's context
4. Apply the fix or suggestion to the correct location

## Custom Review Rules

If the user wants project-specific rules, OCR resolves them in this priority order:

1. `--rule <path>` flag (highest)
2. `<repo>/.opencodereview/rule.json`
3. `~/.opencodereview/rule.json`
4. Built-in system defaults (lowest)

By default, the first matching user rule replaces the built-in system rule. Set `merge_system_rule: true` on a rule entry when the matched system rule and user rule should both be included.

Rule file format:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "path": "**/*.java",
      "rule": "All new methods must validate required parameters for null",
      "merge_system_rule": true
    },
    {
      "path": "**/*mapper*.xml",
      "rule": "Check SQL for injection risks and missing closing tags"
    }
  ]
}
```

To preview which rule applies to a file before reviewing:

```bash
ocr rules check src/main/java/com/example/Foo.java
```

## Gotchas

- **LLM must be configured first** — `ocr review` will fail loudly if no LLM is reachable. Always run `ocr llm test` before the first review.
- **Working directory matters** — `ocr review` operates on the Git repo at the current directory. Use `--repo /path/to/repo` to run from elsewhere.
- **Untracked files are reviewed in workspace mode** — running bare `ocr review` includes staged, unstaged, *and* untracked changes. Stage selectively if you want narrower scope.
- **Large diffs may hit token limits** — files with very large diffs may be truncated. The default `MAX_TOKENS` is 58888 per request.
- **Plan phase triggers at 50 lines** — diffs exceeding 50 changed lines run an extra risk-analysis phase before main review. This adds latency but improves quality.
- **Don't pass `--audience human`** — it streams progress UI that pollutes output. Always use `--audience agent`.
- **Comment language follows config** — set `language` config to `English` or `Chinese` (default: Chinese) to control review comment language.
- **Avoid output truncation** — Large review runs produce verbose output. Never pipe command output to `tail` or `head` as it drops review comments from earlier sections. Redirect output to a file and read it in full.

## Validation

After the review completes, verify success by checking:

1. The command exited with code 0
2. Comments were generated (or "No comments generated" message appears)
3. Warnings (if any) are displayed in stderr

If errors occurred, check the stderr warnings for details about which files failed and why.
